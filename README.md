CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization Course Work

**How do I approach designing software?**
* What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
* What design process did you follow for your project work?
* How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

First and foremost, I adhere to the data gathering process and the resultant requirements for a project. If a project does not meet expectations, it does not serve its purpose. Secure coding is a practice, and, once requirements are met, I must also ensure that users and their data, as well as the system itself, is protected for invalid input or vulnerabilities. For this reason, I perform input validation, audits, peer reviews, and even penetration testing against known OWASP dependency issues.

All of that said, this project has helped me to think more creatively about how to achieve EXACTLY what is required while coding.  Taking advantage of encapsulation, securing methods, and modular code, we were able to rapidly and safely produce multiple objects in an efficient and consistent manner.

**How do I approach developing programs?**
* What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
* How did iteration factor into your development?
* How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

Learning about OpenGL while also considering the scene and requirements incrementally was key to finalizing the project.  Taking portions one at a time and focusing on key elements or strategies goes a long way to both taking full advantage of a technique while also fulfilling a requirement.  As things evolved, the complexity made itself pronounced, but, taking it one step at a time ensured that I was able to identify key code blocks when required.  Navigating the end of the project was clear because of the initial approach, working iterively.

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**
* How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

In general, computer science is an approach to solving problems and applying computational techniques to real-world issues.  It is my hope to work on solutions that positively impact the world and its people.  Being able to now communicate with graphics and visualizations helps to convey ideas in ways previously not in my toolkit.  It will have an impact if I work with data analysis or modeling.
